-- STREAM (in-application): a continuously updated entity that you can SELECT from and INSERT into like a TABLE
-- PUMP: an entity used to continuously 'SELECT ... FROM' a source STREAM, and INSERT SQL results into an output STREAM
-- Create output stream, which can be used to send to a destination
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" ("item_id" INTEGER, "items_count" INTEGER);
-- Create a pump which continuously selects from a source stream (SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001)
-- performs an aggregate count that is grouped by columns ticker over a 10-second tumbling window
-- and inserts into output stream (DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM)
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP" AS INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM"
-- Aggregate function COUNT|AVG|MAX|MIN|SUM|STDDEV_POP|STDDEV_SAMP|VAR_POP|VAR_SAMP)
